# Week One: Introduction

This week will be light on material and will focus on some administrative stuff as well as getting you started in Python.

## Homework

See [here](https://github.com/CSC217/spring_2019/blob/master/week01-introduction/Homework_One.ipynb) for homework. Homework is due February 6th at 6:00 PM sharp. Anything submitted after that will receive a 0.

## Readings

#### [Introduction to Probability and Statistics](http://www.r-5.org/files/books/computers/algo-list/statistics/Sheldon_Ross-Introduction_to_Probability_and_Statistics-EN.pdf)  
Chapters 1 and 2.

#### [Think Stats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/thinkstats2.pdf)  
Chapters 1 and 2.

\* For both of the above readings, Chapter 1 is a general introduction while Chapter 2 will get you prepared for next week.

#### [Getting Started With Jupyter Notebook for Python](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/getting-started-with-jupyter-notebook-for-python-4e7082bd5d46)  
The first part of this article involves downloading Anaconda, which is part of your assignment this week - the second part has some of the tips for using Jupyter that we went over in class. Using Jupyter is essential to the course and it's important that you get comfortable with it.


#### [Intro to Pandas Data Structures](http://gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures/)  
It is essential to the course that you get comfortable with the syntax and style of Pandas ASAP. Pandas is an invaluable tool for Data organization and exploration, similar to a Dataframe in R, a database in SQL, or even an Excel spreadsheet. Pandas is incredibly powerful, but still approachable. Most importantly, getting an early grasp of Pandas will help you start analyzing real-world datasets because you can use it to read CSV files or even pull tables directly from websites such as Wikipedia. You don't need to memorize every single function but you should be comfortable with it structurally so you know the right questions to ask.

#### [Numpy Tutorial Part 1 - Introduction to Arrays](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/numpy-tutorial-part1-array-python-examples/)  
Here is a brief tutorial on using Numpy.

#### [Easier Data Analysis in Python With Pandas](https://www.dataschool.io/easier-data-analysis-with-pandas/) *(Optional)*  
There is a lot here but if you respond better to videos than text this may be helpful for you.

#### [101 Numpy Excercises for Python](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/101-numpy-exercises-python/)  *(Optional)*  
Most of this is honestly beyond the scope of this course but this is a helpful resource if you want to get to another level in Numpy.
