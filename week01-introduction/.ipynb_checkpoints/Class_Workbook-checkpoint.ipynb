Numpy is an extremely powerful package for storing data arrays, so much so that it actually powers **pandas**. **Pandas** helps you explore data by working with dataframes, similar to a SQL database or even an Excel spreadsheet.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Edit Mode and Command Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two 'modes' to Jupyter: edit mode and command mode. When you are in edit mode, the bar to the left will be green, and you can actively type in the cell; the keyboard will act as normal. When you are in command mode, the bar to the left will be blue. Note that when you are in command mode you can press up or down to move between cells.\n",

To create a new cell above your current cell by pressing A (capitalized). Or, you can create a new cell *below* your current cell by pressing B (capitalized). To undo \n",

    "#### Exporting Your File:\n",

    "## Using Binder\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose Binder for this course because it requires the least amount of setup - all you need to do is click a link and an interactive environment with everything you need will be loaded within seconds. That said - it certainly has its limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) A notebook will only last 12 hours in total, and may timeout after 10 minutes of 'inactivity'. Binder is a playground to test around code with, but I would store any answers or anything you plan on submitting elsewhere while you're working on it. **SAVE OFTEN, BE OCD ABOUT HITTING CTRL + S**\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Binder has a limit of 1 - 2 GB of RAM for a given notebook. We should not come anything close to that since we'll be working on relatively small datasets, but it's something to keep in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) If you want to work on something, save it, and work on it later, you can download your file and then upload it later on a new Binder instance. This is a bit primitive, but failsafe.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can also download Python onto your machine (instructions will be in this week's homework) and work that way, I'm sure there will be issues that come up given the different types of machines and operating systems people have. Fundamentally you should be able to complete this course using just Binder."
